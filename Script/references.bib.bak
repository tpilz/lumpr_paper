                   available as GUI as ArcMap toolbar extension
                   Functionalities: - concepts: - channels: flow is
                   concentrated - drainage area: area contributing to a
                   point in a channel - hillslopes: dispersion of flow -
                   specific catchment area: upslope drainage area per
                   unit contour width - general procedure for channel
                   network mapping: - filling pits, flow direction
                   computation, computing contributing area draining to
                   each cell - support area threshold for network
                   delineation: widely used approach; significantly
                   depends on choice of threshold value - objective
                   treshold value: e.g. relationship between slope and
                   contributing area, and constant stream drop property
                   - constant drop property: elevation difference
                   between beginning and end of Strahler order streams;
                   limitation: spatially uniform drainage density -
                   spatial variability can be accounted for, e.g., by
                   identification of local curvature - upwards curved
                   grid cells identified by Peuker and Douglas
                   algorithm: flags pixel of highest evelation from each
                   possible square of four grid cells - multiple flow
                   direction accumulation: - flow direction as vector
                   along direction of steepest downward slope - infinite
                   number of flow direction represented as an angle is
                   possible - flow is shared between two downslope grid
                   cells weighted based on on angle proportioning -
                   smoother and avoids bias with grid directions in
