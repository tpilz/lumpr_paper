	concepts: - channels: flow is concentrated - drainage area: area
	contributing to a point in a channel - hillslopes: dispersion of
	flow - specific catchment area: upslope drainage area per unit contour
	width - general procedure for channel network mapping: - filling
	pits, flow direction computation, computing contributing area draining
	to each cell - support area threshold for network delineation: widely
	used approach; significantly depends on choice of threshold value
	- objective treshold value: e.g. relationship between slope and contributing
	area, and constant stream drop property - constant drop property:
	elevation difference between beginning and end of Strahler order
	streams; limitation: spatially uniform drainage density - spatial
	variability can be accounted for, e.g., by identification of local
	curvature - upwards curved grid cells identified by Peuker and Douglas
	algorithm: flags pixel of highest evelation from each possible square
	of four grid cells - multiple flow direction accumulation: - flow
	direction as vector along direction of steepest downward slope -
	infinite number of flow direction represented as an angle is possible
	- flow is shared between two downslope grid cells weighted based
	on on angle proportioning - smoother and avoids bias with grid directions

	- (semi-)distributed models have shown to alleviate oversimplification
	by accommodating spatial heterogeneity \par
	
	- limitations of traditional conceptual approaches: \par
	
	 - constrained by grid size of available data or size of defined subcatchments
	\par
	
	 - mostly the defined processes are the same among individual model
	units \par
	
	 - sub-grid process heterogeneity merely reflected by distinction
	functions or constitutive relationships but still no generally apllicable
	closure relations found \par
	
	- topographic data to derive response units within a semi-distributed
	modeling approach accounting for process heterogeneity can improve
	model skill \par
	
	- large parameter space of distributed model approaches results in
	poor parameter identifiability and equifinality \par
	
	- methods to constrain the feasible model / parameter space and improve
	identifiability:\par
	
	 - model regularization relying on relations between catchment characteristics
	and model parameters \par
	
	 - expert-based semi-quantitative information on catchment functioning
	("soft data") \par
	
	
	Study areas and data: \par
	
	- 7 catchments in central and wester Europe with different climatological,
	geographical and geological conditions \par
	
	- daily discharge (GRDC) and meteorological (E-OBS) data \par
	
	
	Modelling: \par
	
	- mesoscale hydrological model (mHM) \par
	
	 - distributed, process-based \par
	
	- topography-driven mHM \par
	
	 - explicit representation of landscape classes defined by HAND approach
	and slope: plateau, hillslopes, and wetland \par
	
	 - different model structures for the classes run in parallel, connected
	by common groundwater storage \par
	
	- parameter regionalization \par
	
	 - global parameters defining functional relationships between model
	parameters and catchment characteristics; can be transferred to similar
	catchments without calibration \par
	
	 - multiscale parameter regionalization (MPR): model parameters at
	input data resolution (inferred by calibration of global parameters)
	need to be upscaled to model resolution; method depends on considered
	parameter; global parameter and upscaling for each landscape class
	individually \par
	
	- expert-based constraints: \par
	
	 - constraints for runoff coefficients taking into account the whole
	time series, the high flow period, and the low flow period; period
	defined from expert knowledge about the catchment \par
	
	 - soil moisture storage capacity constraints \par
	
	- calibration: \par
	
	 - for each catchment using MC sampling approach and four objective
	functions \par
	
	- post-calibration evaluation \par
	
	 - model skill assessed by reproducing a variety of observed hydrological
	signatures \par
	
	
	Results: \par
	
	- similar calibration performance \par
	
	- sub-grid process heterogeneity did not show a clear pattern of improvement
	or deterioration \par
	
	- constraints helped to increase model performance and reduce model
	uncertainty \par
	
	- sub-grid heterogeneity and constraints improved transferability
	to other catchments without calibration \par},

  abstract = {Aim:
	
	- digital elevation model networks (DEMON) to respect non-point source
	flow generation
	
	- combines advantages of contour-based models and rectangular DEMs
	
	
	Background and motivation:
	
	- specific contributing area (SCA)
	
	 - total contributing area (TCA) divided by contour segment length
	
	 - TCA: plan area of terrain contributing to a contour segment
	
	 - may be interpreted as an equivalent flow path length
	
	 - concept assumptions:
	
	 a) plan view of flow directions do not change with deth below land
	surface
	
	 b) determined by surface topography
	
	 - limitations: 
	
	 a) terrain with small permeability relative to rainfall rate
	
	 b) subsurface flow lines approximately parallel in plan view to surface
	flow lines
	
	 - application:
	
	 - indicator of discharge assuming spatially uniform and steady rate
	of flow generation (strong approximation of natural conditions)
	
	 - indices as combination of SCA and other variables
	
	 - prediction of location and extent of channel networks
	
	- specific dispersal area (SDA)
	
	 - total dispersal area (TDA) divided by contour segment length
	
	 - TDA: plan area of terrain draining flow from specific contour segment
	
	 - indicates the area of influence of flow generated at specific location
	
	 - terminates at location of convergence or at receiving water body
	
	 - concept assumptions: the same as fow SCA
	
	 - application: e.g. to predict the influence zone of upslope pollution
	sources
	
	- with availability of grid-based DEMs the concept was transferred
	from contour-based elevation maps
	
	- DEMs unsuitable for SDA prediction because of one-dimensional downslope
	flow projection
	
	
	Algorithms for SCA computation:
	
	- D8
	
	 - each pixels spills into one of its eight neighbours in direction
	of steepest descent
	
	 - errors:
	
	 a) parallel flow: 
	
	 - correct only when in cardinal direction (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees)
	
	 - underestimated by factor of 2 in diagonal direction (45, 135, 225,
	315 degrees)
	
	 - underestimated by factor between 1 and 2 in other cases
	
	 b) divergent flow
	
	 - radial flow symmetry not conserved (e.g. on a cone mountain)
	
	 - overestimation by factor of 2 or underestimation approaching up
	to 100 percent
	
	 c) convergent flow
	
	 - radial symmetrie not conserved
	
	 - over- and underestimated not as large as for a cone mountain
	
	- Rho8
