  number = {6},
  abstract = {Aim:
	
	- discussion of controls on morphometric hillslope parameters, focussing
	on flow line convergence and divergence
	
	
	Background and definitions:
	
	- hydrological cycle driven by hydrometeorological fluxes and controlled
	by landscape properties
	
	- limitation of study: typical catchments of humid climates dominated
	by subsurface flow, saturation-excess overland flow, and open-channel
	flow
	
	 - well-defined perennial streams
	
	 - no pits (every point on hillslope drains into a channel)
	
	 - highly permeable soil layer on top of impermeable bedrock
	
	- categories of landscape properties controlling hydrological response:
	
	 - ecological factors
	
	 - hydraulic factors
	
	 - geometric factors
	
	 - not independent, feedbacks between hillslope hydrology and controlling
	factors exist
	
	- classical form of geomorphic information: DEM
	
	 - classical form to use it: 2-D or 3-D gridded spatially distributed
	model (explicit way)
	
	 - imlicit use of applying geomorphic data: respect larger scale geomorphic
	properties, e.g. using similarity indices for hydrological applications
	
	- catchment subdivision into fixed drainage network and fixed hillslope
	
	 - hillslope further broken down into individual homogeneous hillslopes
	characterized by morphometric parameters
	
	 - first order hillslope parameters: easily and directly observable
	from DEM (e.g. length, slope)
	
	 - second order hillslope parameters: more problematic (e.g. convergence,
	divergence)
	
	
	Morphometric parameters:
	
	- hillslope gradient
	
	 - controlled by tectonic and geomorphological setting
	
	- hillslope length
	
	 - related to drainage density
	
	 - defined by location of channel heads
	
	 - clear hydrologic significance
	
	 - controlled by sediment transport which is itself dependent on hillslope
	hydrology
	
	- profile curvature:
	
	 - steepest descent path
	
	 - derived from first and second order partical derivatives of topographic
	surface
	
	 - positive/negative values indicate concave/convex profiles
	
	- contour curvature (or planform curvature):
	
	 - measures curvature of contour lines
	
	 - related to convergence and divergence of flow lines
	
	
	Curvature, dominant processes, hydrological resonse
	
	- flowpath length is important parameters for hillslope models
	
	 - different algorithms: D8 (single flow) vs. multidirectional flow
	algorithms
	
	 - multi flow direction algorithm can take divergence into account
	in contrast to single direction algorithms
	
	 - flowpath length depends on algorithm
	
	- flow distance fields:
	
	 - width function as important parameters equivalent to frequency
	of flow distances
	
	 - also depends on flow direction algorithm
	
	- curvature and dominating processes:
	
	 - curvature can be analysed from width function and statistics of
	grid cells types
	
	 - majority of grid cells divergent but catchment-scale curvature
	convergent because small fraction of grid cells is strongly convergent
	
	 - small contributing area, contour curvature dominantly divergent,
	profile curvature convex, diffusional sediment transports dominate,
	dom-like shape
	
	 - transition zone, episodic transport in form of debris flow and/or
	shallow landsliding, hillslope hollows
	
	 - large contributing area, contour curvature dominantly convergent,
	semi-permanent channel network, fluvial sediment transport most dominant,
	valleys in between hillslopes
	
	- hydrological response:
	
	 - affected by within-hillslope curvature variability
	
	 - contrasting effects from divergent and convergent areas almost
	cancel out at total hydrograph
	
	 - justification for clustering of individual divergent and convergent
	hillslopes into a single hillslope width function},

	of the first Open Source Geospatial Research Symposium, OGRS 2009},

  pages = {35--48},
  abstract = {Aim:
	
	- presenting and discussing experiences with free and open-source
	GIS for pre-processing operations in distributed hydrological modelling
	
	
	Motivation:
	
	- hydrological simulation models:
	
	 a) grid-based models: use pixels of a raster as elementary spatial
	units
	
	 b) vector-based models: use irregular vector geometries (e.g. HRUs
	or hydro-landscapes)
	
	- delineation of spatial units: depends on, e.g., objectives of the
	study, scale, model specifications, and data availability
	
	- during delineation: input data must be transformed, overlaid, etc.
	using GIS
	
	
	Application cases:
	
	- case studies: flash flood simulation in semi-mountainuous catchments,
	influence of landscape and water management practices, understanding
	and modelling capacity of water fluxes in suburban watershed
	
	- data each from various sources with variable quality: DEMs, maps
	of river network, data for geology, pedology, land use
	
	- software: verious free and open-source GIS under Windows tested
	and evaluated for each processing step
	
	
	Pre-processing steps:
	
	1. Delineation of subcatchments from DEM
	
	 - sink removal
	
	 - flow directions
	
	 - slopes
	
	 - drained areas
	
	 - river network delineation based on thresholds
	
	 - subcatchment delineation based on threshols
	
	2. Correction of topology
	
	 - detection and correction of inconsistencies in input data (overlaps,
	holes, spaces between polygons, etc.)
	
	3. Advanced editing of layers
	
	 - optional, case study and model specific steps
	
	 - merging: transformation of input (e.g. line features) into polygons
	and merging of several polygon data layers to derive one layer without
	overlaps
	
	 - intersection of lines and polygons: splitting polygons according
	to lines (e.g. land use polygons according to river network)
	
	 - identification of interfaces: common boundaries of different elements
	(important zones for lateral water exchanges in hydrological modelling)
	
	
	Conclusions:
	
	1. fully topological software (e.g. GRASS) is more convenient for
	processing vector data
	
	2. sometimes scripting facilities are necessary (some processing operations,
	automatisation, or for processing of large datasets)
	
	3. GRASS appeared to be most promising open-source tool
	
	4. detailed and most accurate pre-processing can only be done manually
	
	5. open-source GIS generally well suited for research purposes and
	quick software intercomparisons
	
	
	Limitations:
	
	- open source GIS often not easy to use as: not as user-friendly and
	well documented as proprietary software, maintenance depends on free
	time of developers, etc.
	
	- not well suited for non-experts},

  abstract = {Aim:
	
	- evaluation of three methods to automatically create representative
	slope profiles and two metods to create representative slope lengths
	as pre-processing for the water erosion model WEPP
	
	
	Motivation:
	
	- Water erosion prediction project (WEPP) model: process-based, continuous,
	erosion model
	
	- applicable to hillslopes and watersheds
	
	- runoff and soil loss for every rainfall event
	
	- hillslopes, channels, and relationships within the watershed have
	to be identified
	
	- hillslopes represented by representative length, width, and slope
	
	- pre-processing: manual identification of channels, hillslopes, and
	slope profiles from topographic maps or data records
	
	 - time consuming and subjective
	
	- GIS facilitate model pre-processing
	
	- so far also with GIS methods some degree of ambiguity by manually
	selecting representative hillslopes
	
	
	Methods:
	
	- WEPP model
	
	- preparing analyses of DEM with TOPAZ
	
	- ASCII output used to define watershed components and representative
	slope profiles for each hillslope
	
	- channel identification:
	
	 - delineation of channel network using a DEM
	
	 - define critical source area (CSA): drainage area whose concentrated
	water flow defines the beginning of a channel
	
	 - channel parameters have to be defined manually be the user (width,
	shape, depth, and erodibility)
	
	- hillslope identification:
	
	 - hillslope: set of grid cells draining to the left, right, or top
	of each individual channel
	
	 - extracted from DEM by identifying flowpaths with the aid of TOPAZ
	
	- representative hillslope profiles:
	
	 - can be derived from flowpaths extracted from DEM:
	
	 - flowpaths: the route water travels when flowing from one cell to
	the next, starting from a cell with no inflow and ending at a channel
	
	 - within a hillslope there can be many flowpaths which may eventually
	intersect when approaching a channel
	
	 - determined from four TOPAZ output files: file defining beginning
	and end of flowpaths, raster drainage direction file, hillslope definition
	file, cell slope file
	
	 - representative slope profile:
	
	 - should represent all individual flowpaths within a hillslope
	
	 - three algorithms: 
	
	 1. linear average: assumes that all slope gradients have equal weight
	in their influence on soil loss
	
	 2. exponentially transformed average: assumes exponential relationship
	between slope and soil loss
	
	 3. weighted average: weighting flowpaths by area and length, i.e.
	greater area and lengths assumed to contribute more
	
	- representative profile length:
	
	 - determine the length of the hillsloes in the watershed
	
	 1. Chanleng method: for laterally draining hillslopes the width set
	equal to adjacent channel length; hillslope length is then derived
	from dividing hillslope area by width assuming rectangular shape
	
	 2. Calcleng method: for top hillslopes not matching channel length;
	assumes flowpaths are routes traveled by water and larger and longer
	flowpaths contribute more
	
	
	Results:
	
	- three slope profile methods: 
	
	 - in test case only minimal differences between profiles
	
	 - no significant differences in soil loss, deposition, or sediment
	yield
	
	 - weighted average method is recommended as it is theoretically more
	robust
	
	- two slope length methods:
	
	 - no significant differences in runoff and sediment yield
	
	 - runoff seems to be more different than sediment yield
	
	 - Chanleng method recommended as being more representative, more
	consistent and easy to use},

  abstract = {Aim:
	
	- digital elevation model networks (DEMON) to respect non-point source
	flow generation
	
	- combines advantages of contour-based models and rectangular DEMs
	
	
	Background and motivation:
	
	- specific contributing area (SCA)
	
	 - total contributing area (TCA) divided by contour segment length
	
	 - TCA: plan area of terrain contributing to a contour segment
	
	 - may be interpreted as an equivalent flow path length
	
	 - concept assumptions:
	
	 a) plan view of flow directions do not change with deth below land
	surface
	
	 b) determined by surface topography
	
	 - limitations: 
	
	 a) terrain with small permeability relative to rainfall rate
	
	 b) subsurface flow lines approximately parallel in plan view to surface
	flow lines
	
	 - application:
	
	 - indicator of discharge assuming spatially uniform and steady rate
	of flow generation (strong approximation of natural conditions)
	
	 - indices as combination of SCA and other variables
	
	 - prediction of location and extent of channel networks
	
	- specific dispersal area (SDA)
	
	 - total dispersal area (TDA) divided by contour segment length
	
	 - TDA: plan area of terrain draining flow from specific contour segment
	
	 - indicates the area of influence of flow generated at specific location
	
	 - terminates at location of convergence or at receiving water body
	
	 - concept assumptions: the same as fow SCA
	
	 - application: e.g. to predict the influence zone of upslope pollution
	sources
	
	- with availability of grid-based DEMs the concept was transferred
	from contour-based elevation maps
	
	- DEMs unsuitable for SDA prediction because of one-dimensional downslope
	flow projection
	
	
	Algorithms for SCA computation:
	
	- D8
	
	 - each pixels spills into one of its eight neighbours in direction
	of steepest descent
	
	 - errors:
	
	 a) parallel flow: 
	
	 - correct only when in cardinal direction (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees)
	
	 - underestimated by factor of 2 in diagonal direction (45, 135, 225,
	315 degrees)
	
	 - underestimated by factor between 1 and 2 in other cases
	
	 b) divergent flow
	
	 - radial flow symmetry not conserved (e.g. on a cone mountain)
	
	 - overestimation by factor of 2 or underestimation approaching up
	to 100 percent
	
	 c) convergent flow
	
	 - radial symmetrie not conserved
	
	 - over- and underestimated not as large as for a cone mountain

  abstract = {Aim:
	
	- development of a GIS-hydrological model system, ArcView-SWAT (AVSWAT)
	for combined watershed assessment and analysis
	
	
	Motivation:
	
	- public concern about water quality and threats from pollution from
	point, nonpoint, or diffusive sources
	
	- hydrological distributed models together with GIS technology facilitates
	control and management of water quality
	
	- fundamental elements: 
	
	 1. GIS for bi-directional automated data-transfer toward and away
	from the model with interactive analysis tools
	
	 2. growing availability and quality of datasets as descriptors for
	important hydrological variables
	
	
	AVSWAT:
	
	- Windows-based, SWAT2000, ArcView
	
	- coupling between SWAT2000 and ArcView:
	
	 1. loose: pre-processor (model input file generation) + post-processor
	(display model output); data transfer via database tables and ASCII
	files
	
	 2. close: enhanced environment for data transfer between the model
	and the GIS database
	
	 3. tight: data transfer accomplished by routines addressed by tools
	of ArcView
	
	- implemented and distributed as ArcView extension
	
	- GIS computation engine and Windows-based GUI
	
	- sequence of linked tools:
	
	 1. Watershed delineation
	
	 - based on DEM
	
	 - sink-filling of DEM
	
	 - D8 algorithm with steepest descent for strea delineation
	
	 - further set of accessible tools with user options for watershed
	and stream segmentation
	
	 2. HRU definition
	
	 - based on soil and landcover data in raster or vector format
	
	 - landuse must be re-classification to SWAT categories
	
	 - land use and soil maps clipped to watershed boundaries and overlaid
	
	 3. Weather station definition
	
	 - stations and time series for SWAT meteorological variables can
	be imported
	
	 4. SWAT database
	
	 - contains seven parameter databases
	
	 5. parameterization, editing, and scenario management
	
	 - model input parameter files creation based on HRUs and data from
	the parameter database
	
	 - parameter files can be viewed, edited and checked by the user
	
	 - land and water management practices can be defined
	
	 - merging of discharge records (water, sediment, nutrients, bacteria
	etc.) to simulation
	
	 6. model execution
	
	 - set simulation control parameters
	
	 - start SWAT model simulation
	
	 7. reading, mapping, charting results
	
	 - data post-processor
	
	 - output data format conversions
	
	 - model output presentation
	
	 8. calibration
	
	 - interactive manual model calibration
	
	
	Features:
	
	1. user friendly and easy
	
	2. well known established formats
	
	3. facilitated watershed segmentation
	
	4. simplified reclassification of raster maps
	
	5. simle inclusion of management scenarios
	
	6. interactive model run and calibration
	
	7. comparison of scenarios

	preserving three-dimensional physiographic heterogeneity
	
	- basic conclusions for the HRU concept:
	
	 1. topography and soil types are closely associated
	
	 2. soils and topographic sequences can be grouped into pedo-topographical
	associations
	
	 3. further differentiation into pedo-topo-geological associations
	if geology is relevant
	
	 4. general land use classification into: agriculture, rangeland,
	forest, and impervious areas
	
	 5. each land use class is located on a specific pedo-topo-geological
	association
	
	- basic assumptions
	
	 1. homogeneous set of hydrological process dynamics for each land
	use class on a pedo-topo-geological association
	
	 2. dynamics controlled by management and physical properties
	
	
	HRU generation
	
	- two ways:
	
	 1. establishment of a conceptual link between HRUs and the model
	using a GIS
	
	 2. interactive linkage, where model parameter files are generated
	during delineation of HRUs in GIS
	
	- steps needed for delineation
	
	 1. each pysiographical property is represented by a separate two-dimensional
	polygon: atmosphere (rainfall distribution), topograhy (slope and
	aspect), vegetation, soil, geology
	
	 2. polygones are transformed into a raster format
	
	 3. HRUs delineated by sorting grid cells which fulfill common physiographic
	criteria
	
	 4. generated smaller classes have to be merged with similar larger
	classes to keep number of HRU manageable},

	- increasing availability of DEMs and terrain analysis tools
	
	- issues related to landscape discretization and parameterization
	
	- spatial heterogeneity and parameters typically aggregated at various

	- effects of watershed subdivision of simulation of runoff, sediment,

	 - runoff in general not very sensitive to watershed subdivision level
	
	 - sediment and nutrient modelling very sensitive
	
	- proper consideration of uncertainty in predictions very important
	
	- increase in subdivision level increases input data preparation,

	Methods:
	
	- study area: Xiangxi river, Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) area, China;
	northern subtropical climate; spatial variability in topography and
	land use; many anthropogenic changes
	
	- data: DEM, land use, soil, climate data
	
	- watershed subdivision using TOPAZ with eight different levels by
	manipulating two main parameters: critical source area (CSA) and

	- model: SLURP; conceptual hydrological model, daily time step, for

  abstract = {Aim:
	
	- software package IOSWAT to perform the entire process of hydrologic
	modelling: pre-processing, modelling, and post-processing
	
	- identification of an appropriate level of discretization during
	pre-processing and adequate disaggregation of model results to a
	grid during post-processing
	
	
	Motivation:
	
	- distributed models essential for estimation of land use change effects
	
	- spatial aggregation of model parameters has enormous impact on model
	uncertainty
	
	- model uncertainty differs between single spatial elements and the
	watershed outlet
	
	- identification of an appropriate scale of subwatersehds or HRUs
	usually done by trial and error
	
	
	Model:
	
	- SWAT
	
	- two levels of landscape discretization:
	
	 1. Subwatersheds
	
	 - study uses tool TOPAZ for delineation
	
	 2. HRUs
	
	- SWAT pre-processing for input file derivation: SWAT/GRASS interface
	
	
	Spatial analysis tool:
	
	- definition of "apropriate" discretization level:
	
	 - almost maximum average model efficiency
	
	- definition of "optimal" discretization level:
	
	 - at least an appropriate level of discretization
	
	- heterogeneity of data distribution in the watershed of significant
	influence on required number of modelling units
	
	- heterogeneity can be measured by entropy (can be calculated using
	a moving window technique)
	
	- modelling units assigned by a set of nominal input parameters
	
	- entropy characterizes the minimum of spatial detail represented
	by modelling units to reach appropriate level of discretization
	
	- introducing HRUs increases heterogeneiy and entropy is added to
	entropy of subbasins
	
	
	IOSWAT:
	
	- software package synchronizing data interchange between GRASS, TOPAZ,
	SUSAT, SWAT/GRASS, SWAT, and OUTGRASS for pre-processing, simulation,
	and post-processing},

	- present an alternative to the HRU approach called Grouped Response
	Unit (GRU)
	
	
	Motivation:
	
	- distributed models capture spatial variability
	
	- mostly use small subbasin elements such as hydrological response
	units (HRU) or representative elementary areas (REA)
	
	- usually an assembly of lumped models applied to a collection of
	HRUs
	
	- number of HRUs depends on basin characteristics
	
	- need for new approaches to hydrologic modelling: incorporating spatial
	detail while retaining computational efficiency
	
	- main problem: determining hydrologically homogeneous area
	
	
	Grouped Response Unit (GRU):
	
	- computational unit
	
	- consists of a subwatershed
	
	- range of land cover characteristics
	
	- the same meteorological forcing
	
	- size limited to area of uniform meterological conditions or element
	travel times are small compard to basin travel time or duration of
	meteorological events
	
	- runoff: runoff contributions from each unique land cover modelled
	identically, weighted according to areal fraction covered in GRU,
	GRU outflow routed through drainage system
	
	- identical parameters for specific land cover type
	
	- routing parameters also depend on topography
	
	- assumptions: topographic and land cover effects outweigh variations
	of soil types
	
	- difference from conventional approaches: runoff generation elements
	(GRUs) are not considered hydrologically homogeneous
	
	- exact location of HRUs within GRUs is not significant, only percent
	cover is used for characterization
	
	- shape of the element is not restricted},

  abstract = {Aim:
	
	- explore effects of spatial discretization and model parameterization
	on daily streamflow simulations and extreme seasonal runoff characteristics
	
	
	Motivation:
	
	- reliable estimates and predictions of extreme runoff considering
	future climate and/or land cover changes needed
	
	- two approaches:
	
	 1) statistical methods for finding data-driven models
	
	 2) continuous streamflow simulation using hydrological models
	
	- factors influencing hydrological models:
	
	 a) spatial process representation
	
	 b) model parameterization
	
	 c) model calibration
	
	 - little is known about sensitivity of extreme runoff characteristics
	to these factors
	
	- hydrological resonse sensitive to:
	
	 - spatial heterogeneity of basin physical characteristics
	
	 - spatio-temporal variability of meteorological inputs
	
	- lumped vs. spatially distributed models
	
	 - no clear advantage of distributed over lumped models with contradictory
	conclusions in different studies
	
	 - over-parameterization and equifinality problems in distributed
	models
	
	 - possible solutions: spatial agregation (HRUs), regionalization
	methods (a priori links of model parameters with catchment characteristics)
	
	- estimators / objective functions during calibration
	
	 - different estimators can result in different model simulations
	
	 - no sensitivity analysis of estimators on extreme runoff characteristics
	
	
	Methods:
	
	- 22 basins of different sizes in upper Neckar basin, Germany
	
	- data: meteorological data (external drift Kriging interpolation),
	DEM, soil, geology, land cover
	
	- model: mHM, conceptual mesoscale hydrological model, processes largely
	based on HBV, lumped and distributed version
	
	- two spatial parameterization schemes:
	
	 1) HRUs delineated by k-means clustering
	
	 2) multiscale parameter regionalization (MPR):
	
	 a) parameters at fine resolution regionalized through nonlinear transfer
	functions linking them with basin caracteristics (e.g. pedotransfer
	functions)
	
	 b) parameters values at larger scale linked with corresponding parameters
	at finer scales through upscaling operator
	
	- runoff characteristics:
	
	 - specific volume, total duration, frequency, cumulative specific
	deficit, total drought duration, maximum drought intensity
	
	 - peak over treshold and truncation level methods employed to derive
	characteristics
	
	 - 95th and 10th percentile of daily observed streamflow used for
	treshold and truncation level definition
	
	- calibration:
	
	 - dynamically dimensioned search (DDS) algorithm, single objective,
	global
	
	 - three different variations of objective functions tested; each
	with emphasis on high flows, low flows, and combination
	
	 - seasonal extreme runoff characteristics used as penalty term
	
	
	Results:
	
	- simulation performance strongly depends on type of objective function
	(for lumped more than distributed model)
	
	- distributed version generally performs better than lumped version
	
	- performance depends on parameterization method: MPR performs better
	and shows less variability than HRU due to accounting for sub-grid
	variability
	
	- model calibrated using combined estimator in general performed better
	than using single objective function and variability was lower
	
	- critical number of parameters might be required to obtain good performance,
	but overparameterization should be avoided
	
	- MPR more robust and less dependent on calibration location than
	HRU
	
	- lumped simulation with largest variability (widest uncertainty bounds);
	MPR achieved highest predictive performance
	
	- specific volume and total duration simulated better than frequency
	of high flows
	
	- lack of predictability of high flows in summer, likely related to
	occurence of convective precipitation events badly covered in precipitation
	input},

	- develop and test an operational method for automated parameterization

	Motivation:
	
	- semi-distributed models incorporate spatial variation of hydrologically
	relevant characteristics, e.g. watershed topographic properties
	
	- traditionally, information have been derived manually from maps
	
	- GIS are increasingly employed
	
	- techniques for automatic derivation of watershed information from
	DEMs exist
	
	
	Methods:
	
	- SLURP: 
	
	 - semi-distributed physically-based hydrological basin model
	
	 - watershed divided into aggregated simulation areas (ASA) with specific
	land cover patterns
	
	 - needs physiographic parameters, time series data, and physical
	parameters
	
	 - based on vertical process representation and nonlinear storage
	approach
	
	- TOPAZ:
	
	 - digital terrain analysis
	
	 - processes raster DEM to derive a range of topographic and geometric
	variables
	
	 - removes depressions and flat areas from DEM
	
	 - flow direction calculation using D8
	
	 - watershed boundary identification from flow directions
	
	 - drainage network derivation based on critical source area (CSA),
	pruned using minimal source channel length (MSCL), linked and order
	using Strahler system
	
	 - generation of landscape information and parameters
	
	- SLURPAZ:
	
	 - interface between TOPAZ and SLURP
	
	 - processes TOPAZ output for use in SLURP
	
	 - processes additional information needed for SLURP (climate data,
	land cover, routing data)
	
	- analysis: comparison of new automated segmentation and parameterization
	with earlier manual segmentation and parameterization
	
	
	Results:
	
	- in general similar results for automated and manual segmentation
	and parameterization
	
	- most of the performance measures slightly better for automated method
	
	- automated method much faster and easily allows to investigate multiple

  abstract = {Aim:
	
	- GIS tool Geo-MHYDAS to help users of MHYDAS to perform complex landscape
	discretization
	
	
	Characteristics:
	
	1. takes into account natural and man-made landscape features
	
	2. linear and polygonial hydrological units
	
	3. build a topology connecting hydrological units
	
	4. full automatation of discretization process
	
	
	Motivation:
	
	- distributed models use different methods for landscape representation
	
	- grid based:
	
	 - straightforward process representation, computationally efficient
	and simple analysis, structure compatible with remote sensing techniques
	and GIS
	
	 - unsatisfactory solutions for representation of irregularly sized
	lanscape features and gradients, long calculation time and over-parameterization
	in case of fine resolution
	
	- cell-based segmentation:
	
	 - finite number of cell units such as sub-catchments, interconnected
	bounded elements, or rectangular cells
	
	- TINs
	
	- contour-based methods of terrain analysis
	
	- HRUs
	
	- no approach explicitly take into account man-made landscape features
	
	
	Geo-MHYDAS:
	
	- use of GRASS GIS
	
	- independent GRASS scripts in SHELL and PERL
	
	1. processing of geographical objects
	
	 - natural, e.g. sub-catchments, soil, geology
	
	 - man-made, e.g. ditches
	
	 - no limitation in number
	
	 - tasks on imported spatial data: 
	
	 - verification: identification and fix of topological errors
	
	 - subbasin delineation: fill DEM sinks, compute flow direction and
	accumulation (r.watershed), create basin map (r.water.outlet); addionally
	takes man-made networks into account forcing flow direction
	
	 - object modification: dissolution of small objects, splitting of
	pre-existing objects, smoothing of boundaries, modification of geometry
	to match other objects
	
	2. creation of hydrological units
	
	 - successive overlay of layers; herein respecting a user-defined
	hierarchical order accounting for hydrological importance for each
	type of geographical object
	
	 - selective remove of unwanted units (e.g. too small or badly shaped
	bjects) according to user-defined criteria
	
	 - extraction of linear and areal hydrological units
	
	3. building of topology
	
	 - each unit has exactly one neighbouring unit, linear or areal
	
	 - definition of process order as modification of the Strahler order
	ensuring processing of upstream units before downstream units within
	the model
	
	 - relations between units described by parameters governing water
	flows (nature of downstream unit, label of downstream unit, process
	order, distance to downstream unit, slope gradient
	
	 - algorithm for solving loop problems (units being upstream and downstream
	neigbours of a given unit)
	
	
	Case study:
	
	- aim: test different scenarios involving possible changes in man-made
	features within the catchment and examination of hydrological consequences
	
	- small vineyard catchment in France; two distinct features: tilled
	soil with high permeability, non-tilled fields with low permeability
	
	- model: MHYDAS, distributed physically-based rainfall-runoff model,
	used mainly in farming contexts
	
	- scenarios: alterning spatial distributions of tilled/non-tilled
	fields; one scenario removing man-made drainage-network considering
	natural drainage network only
	
	- alternative discretization carried out with ArcHydro tools
	
	- impact of landscape discretization measured by three indices: runoff
	coefficient, peak discharge, lag-time
	
	- conclusions:
	
	 - explicit representation of topology of hydrological units account
	for possible re-infiltration of water along slopes in contrast to
	classical discretization approach with ArcHydro resulting in less
	runoff
	
	 - important to take man-made drainage network into account as this
	alters the produced runoff significantly},

	- Automated Geospatial Watershed Assessment (AGWA) tool for rapid
	application of SWAT200 and KINEROS2 model and visualization of results
	
	
	Motivation:
	
	- advances in linkage of GIS with models enhanced capacity for sciences
	to develop and apply model
	
	- no available tool provided suitable interface for research and application
	development
	
	
	AGWA:
	
	- extension for ArcView
	
	- free, modular, open-source suite of programs
	
	- integrates specific processing for SWAT2000 and KINEROS2
	
	- required input: sink-free DEM, soil map, land use map
	
	- AGWA provides tools to remove spurious sinks
	
	- steps:
	
	1. watershed delineation
	
	 - based on flow direction and accumulation from DEM
	
	 - watershed subdivided into elements as required by models
	
	2. parameter estimation
	
	 - watershed intersected with soil and landcover data
	
	 - parameters estimated from GIS analysis and look-up tables
	
	3. rainfall generation
	
	 - SWAT: user provides gauges with rainfall data, interpolation with
	Thiessen polygons possible
	
	 - KINEROS: predefined rainfall events, design storms can be generated,
	spatially distributed rainfall must be generated outside AGWA
	
	4. model execution
	
	5. change analysis
	
	 - optional component giving straightforward method for change analysis
	
	6. visualization of results
	
	
	Uses of AGWA:
	
	- hydrologic modeling tool
	
	- landcover change impact assessment
	
	- nested interdisciplinary (ecological and hydrological) multi-scale
	modeling approaches
	
	- watershed planning (water ressources management)
	
	- best management practice and assessment of impairment by pollutants},

  abstract = {Aim:
	
	- methodology for delineating hillslopes and extracting width functions
	from digital terrain data
	
	
	Motivation:
	
	- hillslope as most common unit for catchment subdivision
	
	- hillslope width functions (HWF) play central role in hillslope-based
	models
	
	- several terrain analysis algorithms exist but less and no standardized
	metods for hillslope delineation
	
	
	Method:
	
	1) hillslope delineation:
	
	 - DEM
	
	 - flow direction calculation (steepest descent)
	
	 - flow accumulation
	
	 - river network extraction
	
	 - subdivision into subbasins
	
	 - algorithm for extraction of hillslopes (distinguish between headerwater
	and lateral hillslopes, i.e. subbasin consists of river segment and
	two or three hillslopes)
	
	2) characterization of plan shape and profile curvature
	
	 - plan shape calculated from DEM:
	
	 - tangential curvature perpendicular to the slope gradient
	
	 - elevation line can be convergent, divergent, or uniform
	
	 - calculation of convergence ratio for every hillslope
	
	 - profile curvature: 
	
	 - refers to rate of change of slope
	
	 - elevation line can be concave, convex, or straight
	
	 - calculation of convexity ratio for every hillslope
	
	 - convergence and convexity ratios used in fuzzy logic algorithm
	for classification into nine elementary landform classes of Dikau
	
	3) Hillslope Width Function (HWF)
	
	 - criteria: 1) monotonicity to avoid flow singularities; 2) conservation
	of surface area for mass conservation in the model
	
	 - different algorithms for lateral (resulting in rectangular form)
	and headwater hillslopes (resulting in triangular form)
	
	 - for each hillslope the distance from river segment to the divide
	and the width at the divide are calculated
	
	
	Conclusions:
	
	- pre-processing algorithm for use in catchment models using hillslopes
	as computational elements
	
	- some difficulty in flat catchments
	
	- relatively quick and flexible
	
	- particular useful for hillslope-storage Boussinesq model},

  journal = {Advances in Water Resources },
  year = {1998},
  volume = {22},

  number = {4},
  abstract = {Aim:
	
	- develop a general framework for hydrological model development respecting
	balances of mass, energy, and momentum using advantages of distributed
	and lumped models
	
	
	Objectives:
	
	- employing an averaging approach from flow porous media to derive
	watershed scale balance equations for mass, momentum, energy, and
	entropy
	
	- watershed divided into smaller entities over which equations are
	averaged in space and time
	
	- definition of jump conditions for transfer of mass, momentum, energy
	and entropy across system boundaries
	
	- constitutive relationships for mass exchange between stores and
	surroundings in compliance with second law of thermodynamics
	
	
	Motivation:
	
	- physically based distributed models:
	
	 - advantage: explicitly consider conservation of mass and momentum
	
	 - shortcommings: computationally overwhelming, need for detailed
	information mostly not available, detailed output often not needed
	for practical application, over parameterization and poor parameter
	identifiability
	
	- lumped conceptual models:
	
	 - advantage: do not need detailed information as watershed is represented
	as connected conceptual storages
	
	 - disadvantages: only respect the mass balance, parameters often
	lack a physical meaning
	
	- no accepted general framework for describing a hydrological system
	
	- paper motivated by approach for multi-phase flow in porous media
	by Hassanizadeh and Gray
	
	
	Framework:
	
	- watershed as an open thermodynamic system (mass, momentum, energy
	and entropy are exchanged with surrounding regions)
	
	- exchange driven by mass input, extraction, and transfer
	
	- fundamental components of a watershed: hillslopes organized around
	a river network
	
	- division of the watershed into smaller elements defined as representative
	elementary watersheds (REW)
	
	- averaging of conservation equations over the REW
	
	- incorporation of sub-REW variability in an effective manner
	
	- time interval chosen application-specific whereas smaller temporal
	fluctuations are filtered out
	
	- determination of relationships between exchange terms and catchment
	storages in conservation equations
	
	
	REW:
	
	- autonomous functional watershed unit
	
	- includes all basic functional components: channels and hillslopes
	
	- drainage network as basic organizing structure
	
	- REW size depends on spatial and temporal resolution for the representation
	of watershed response as well as available data
	
	- each REW as a single discrete point and the original watershed is
	substituted by an agglomeration of points
	
	- points connected with each other by main channel of each REW
	
	- REW divided into five sub-regions:
	
	 1. u-subregion: unsaturated zone
	
	 2. s-subregion: saturated zone
	
	 3. o-subregion: saturated overland flow
	
	 4. r-subregion: main channel reach of the REW
	
	 5. c-subregion: concentrated overland flow (network of channels,
	rills, gullies, ephemeral streams, Hortonian overland flow)
	
	- balance equations derived for all sub-regions
	
	- simplifications and jump conditions for thermodynamic exchange between
	different phases, between different subregions, and between REWs
	derived from balance equations and a set of assumptions
	
	- second law of thermodynamics included to derive constitutive relationships
	
	 - i.e. rate of entropy production has to be non-negative for the
	physical system under consideration},

	- multiscale parameter regionalization (MPR) is proposed to overcome

	- model complexity is reduced and thus the parameter uncertainty
	
	- ascertain effective parameters at various modeling scales using
	the same upscaling operators without need to recalibrate global parameters
	
	- continuity of mass satisfied to a larger extent (if global parameters
	for a coarse scale are used at finer scale)
	
	
	Motivation:
	
	- hydrologic models evolved from lumed to spatially distributed models
	
	- still not contributed to finding the right answers due to nonlinearity,
	scale, uniqueness, equifinality, and uncertainty
	
	- physically-based models:
	
	 - spatially distributed media properties and boundary conditions
	are essentially unknown or poorly known at the scale of physical
	equations
	
	 - modeleres forced to find effective parameters via calibration often
	resulting in overparameterization
	
	- conceptual models:
	
	 - parsimonious and computationally efficient
	
	 - little attention to spatial distribution of inputs, state variables,

	 - require calibration
	
	- parameter calibration:

	- regionalization techniques:
	
	 - aims: reduce model overparameterization, confine parameter search
	to realistic values, allow information transfer
	
	 - groups: postregionalization (after calibration), and calibration
	of transfer function parameters (assuming a priori relationship between
	basin predictors and model parameters)
	
	 - standard regionalization (SR) techniques: basin predictors defined
	at the same scale as modelling units
	
	
	System conception:
	
	- masoscale river basin is an open system
	
	- mathematical definition:
	
	 1) partial differential equations (PDE)
	
	 - basin characteristics continuous in time
	
	 - media characteristics and boundary conditions known at point scale
	
	 - governing processes scalable
	
	 2) ordinary differential equations (ODE)
	
	 - characteristics discrete in time
	
	 - unknown scaling laws
	
	 - most often used in mesoscale hydrological models as assumptions
	of scalability and continuity difficult to justify
	
	 - stochastic term to reflect uncertainty can be included
	
	
	Multiscale parameter regionalization (MPR):
	
	- hierarchy of spatial scales:
	
	 1) Level 0: describe subgrid variability of basin characteristics
	
	 2) Level 1: scale of dominant hydrological processes, the modeling
	scale
	
	 3) Level 2: scale of meteorological forcings
	
	- two phases:
	
	 1) parameter regionalization:
	
	 - a priori relationships between model parameters and distributed
	basin predictors at level 0
	
	 - linear and nonlinear transfer functions and scalar values (global
	parameters, quasi-scale-independent)
	
	 - based on process understanding and/or empirical evidence
	
	 - objectives: reduce model overparameterization, ease transferability
	of global parameters, increase model performance, accounting for
	subgrid variability
	
	 2) upscaling:
	
	 - upscaling of regionalized model parameters from level 0 to level
	1
	
	 - challenge: finding best upscaling rules (upscaling operators)
	
	 - should take into account subgrid variability of a parameter and
	its propagation via nonlinear equations
	
	 - a number of possible operators: selection should be based on conceptual
	and/or process understanding and should be evaluated
	
	
	Conclusions:
	
	- MPR and SR exhibit no substantial differences in model performance
	when calibrated and applied at the same scale
	
	- differences apparent when global parameters were calibrated at coarser
	scale and then transferred to finer scale
	
	 - MPR performs better and reduced computational demand
	
	- dynamics of state variables and fluxes varied substantially depending
	on regionalization method
	
	- MPR better for prediction in ungaged basins},

	- other methods for triangulated irregular networks or contour elevation

	- increasing availability of high reslution data
	
	- shortcommings of classic work flow: 
	
	 - pit filling alters original DEM and may remove important landscape

	 - wrong assumption that channels begin at the same flow accumulation

	GeoNet:
	
	- originally MATLAB and C, further developed to include GDAL libraries

	- workflow:
	
	 1) nonlinear filtering of elevation data
	
	 - to remove small scale variability (e.g roads in engineered landscapes)
	
	 - for urban landscapes a user input is required: filter box size
	
	 2) identification of convergent features and first estimate of channel

	 3) channel heads and network extraction

	hydrologic connectivity},
  journal = {Water Resour. Res.},
  year = {2013},
  volume = {49},
  pages = {6834--6846},
  number = {10},
  abstract = {Aim:
	
	- introduction of the Catchment Connectivity Model (CCM) as a framework
	emphasizing external and internal hydrologic interpretation and prediction
	using landscape structure (topography) as basic building block
	
	
	Objective:
	
	- hydrologic connectivity definition:
	
	 "... the water-mediated transport of matter, energy, and organisms
	within or between elements of the landscape that can be unidirectional
	or bidirectional and temporally variable"
	
	- test hydrologic connectivity concept:
	
	 1. can the concept be implemented in a simple, spatially explicit
	hydrologic model?
	
	 2. can it be used to simulate observed streamflow dynamics?
	
	 3. can the model yield internally consistent dynamics without parameter
	fit?
	
	
	Motivation:
	
	- comlex process-based vs. simple conceptual models with different
	advantages and shortcommings
	
	- desire for models that combine advantages: providing efficient,
	process-based hypotheses about streamflow generation
	
	- critical to determine:
	
	 1. factors affecting hydrologic functioning
	
	 2. relative importance of factors to select model structures a priori
	
	 3. variation across different catchment types
	
	- problem: lack of coordination between experimentalists and modellers
	
	- challenge: quantification of relationship between catchment form
	and hydrologic functioning required
	
	
	Catchment Connectivity Model:
	
	- hypothesis: frequency of landscape-scale hydrologic connectivity
	determines catchment runoff magnitude
	
	- primary components: 
	
	 1. landscape analysis: delineation of hillslopes based on upslope
	accumulated area derived from DEM 
	
	 2. soil moisture accounting: each hillslope has own moisture storage
	(precip - aet - outflow)
	
	 3. hydrologic connectivity estimation: based on storage threshold
	function defining critical volume for a hillslope to become hydrologically
	connected and contribute discharge to the stream
	
	- frequency-based rather than magnitude-based connectivity: each hillslope
	has the same rate of release if connected
	
	
	Features:
	
	- simple conceptual hydrologic model
	
	- requires calibration but is physically-based and parameters are
	physically interpretable
	
	- combines strengths of classical conceptual and physically-based
	models
	
	- for shallow catchments with topographically driven connectivity
	as dominant process
	
	- model development based on field observations rather than perceived
	process understanding
	
	
	Limitations:
	
	- dominant process concept results in exclusion of secondary processes
	
	- constant outflow rate assumption for all connected hillslopes; no
	variation in magnitude of throughflow which at least might play a
	minor role
	
	- losses and gains between streams and groundwater not included
	
	- assumes insignificant overland flow
	
	- contributing area of individual hillslopes neglected in contrary
	to traditional storage approaches
	
	- model parameters could not be estimated a priori despite their physical
	interpretability
	
	
	Performance:
	
	- strong correspondence between measured and modelled data
	
	- minor disagreement connectivity due to: 
	
	 - deep groundwater contribution at low flows
	
	 - potential errors in model structure and assumptions
	
	 - model does not take into account spatial or temporal variability
	of factors
	
	 - model driving data may not be fully representative
	
	- model generally underestimated peak flows
	
	- good agreement in wet-up and recession periods},

  abstract = {- Background:
	
	 - Variety of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS):
	
	 - word processors
	
	 - web browsers
	
	 - drawing
	
	 - scientific applications
	
	 - GIS
	
	 - popularity measures:
	
	 - number of projects started (increasing)
	
	 - increasing financial support
	
	 - download rates of software
	
	 - documented number of use cases of FOSS
	
	 - FOSS movement:
	
	 - freedom of use and modification of software
	
	 - also includes free availability of data
	
	 - facilitaed by (online) platforms
	
	- three domains:
	
	 - 'free' software: freedom to ...
	
	 1. run the program for any purpose
	
	 2. study how the program works and adapt it to your needs
	
	 3. redistribute copies
	
	 4. improve the program and release improvements to the public
	
	 - no restrictions whether improved software has to be offered for
	free or can be sold
	
	 - 2. and 4. imply that source code has to be delivered with the software
	
	 - defined by free software foundation (FSF)
	
	 - 'proprietary' software:
	
	 - closed software: non-modifiable software (opposed to freedom 2)
	
	 - shareware: software free for download and use, usually do not allow
	study and modification; 'free' software in terms of 'free beer'
	
	 - 'open source' software:
	
	 - source code accessible
	
	 - source code can be studied
	
	 - no freedom of modification and redistribution
	
	 - term introduced by open source initiative (OSI); properties of
	initiative not exactly compatible with free software definition (rather
	a philosophical difference)
	
	 - 'free and open source' software (FOSS): in this article FSF and
	OSI certified license
	
	- licenses
	
	 - several FOSS licenses with different degrees of protection of the
	four freedoms
	
	 - most protective license guaranteeing for all four freedoms is the
	GPL
	
	 - 'copyleft': derived or modified software and extracted code must
	be covered by the same license
	
	 - copyleft problems if free software should be coupled with porprietary
	software: LGPL to avoid problems
	
	 - common GPL misconceptions:
	
	 1. only a release of the software requires publishing the source
	code; code can be kept private and licensed GPL as long as the software
	has not been distributed to the public
	
	 2. copies of the software can be sold and download fees be raised
	
	 3. software created with GPL software is not affected by GPL (only
	if it contains GPL licensed code sniplets)
	
	- GIS software world:
	
	 - open source GIS organizations
	
	 - open source geospatial foundation (OSGeo): hosts software projects,
	publishes a journal, founded education and curriculum committee,
	organizes conferences, donates an award
	
	 - open geospatial consortium (OGC): develops standards for processing
	and exchange of geodata (also for proprietary software)
	
	 - software categories forming spatial data infrastructures (SDI):
	
	 - software to collect, prepare, analyse data (desktop GIS)
	
	 - databases to store data
	
	 - web server and client software to deliver data online
	
	 - software libraries, third party plug-ins or software extensions
	providing specific functionalities
	
	 - grouping of projects
	
	 - based on development platform (e.g. using C++, JAVA, or Python,
	etc.)
	
	 - foundation and maintenance (commercial vs. enthusiasts vs. research
	projects at universities or other oagnizations vs. support from governmental
	agencies)
	
	- major FOSS desktop GIS projects
	
	 - desktop GIS: runs on PC, allows user to display, query, update,
	and analyse data
	
	 - evaluation of several FOS GIS products (GRASS, QGIS, MapWindow,
	etc.)
	
	- FOS vs. proprietary GIS
	
	 - advantages FOS:
	
	 - no fees to pay
	
	 - support of standard and commonly used formats
	
	 - unrestricted use
	
	 - support from several providers
	
	 - disadvantages FOS:

	 - software components should work well together
	
	 - usually well documented
	
	 - FOS in teaching:

	 - simplification of Navier-Stokes equations (dependency on gravitation;
	neglecting variation of pressure)
	
	 - depends on geometry of hillslope
	
	- simplification of three-dimensional soil mantle
	
	 - one-dimensional drainable pore space profile
	
	 - represents dominant topographic controls:
	
	 a) plan shape via width function, i.e. hillslope width at certain
	flow distance
	
	 - possible natural plan shapes: convergent (width increases with
	distance), divergent (width decreases), uniform (width remains constant)
	
	 b) profile curvature via soil depth function, i.e. average soil depth
	at certain flow distance
	
	- soil moisture storage capacity function:
	
	 - defines vertical dimension of hillslope and soil moisture propagation
	in space and time
	
	 - width function * soil depth function * drainable porosity
	
	 - constrained by continuity equation and some form of Darcy's law
	
	
	Hillslope-storage Boussinesq equation:
	
	- modification to Boussinesq equation: adopts Darcy's law as dynamic
	equation
	
	- describe flow within arbitrary plan geometry
	
	- numerically solved: finite differences in space; multistep ODE solver
	in time
	
	 - code in MATLAB
	
	- hillslope types:
	
	 - polynomial function to describe hillslope by profile curvature
	and plan curvature parameters
	
	 - from specific parameter realisation, drainage area and plan shape
	of the hillslope can be derived
	
	
	Main conclusion:
	
	- dynamic response of hillslopes during recharge and drainage depends
	very much on plan shape and bedrock slope
	
	- convergent hillslopes drain much slower and divergent hillslopes},

  journal = {J. Hydrol. Eng.},
  year = {2004},
  volume = {9},
  pages = {288--302},
  number = {4},
  abstract = {Aim:
	
	- use of multiple-resolution triangulated irrgular network (TIN) mesh
	to represent the surface terrain in a watershed model
	
	- presentation of a GIS methodology for constructing TIN terrain models
	
	
	Features:
	
	- TIN models are capable of capturing topographic variability that
	cannot be achieved via raster aggregation
	
	- TINs are a promising tool for assessing DEM quality
	
	- flat or gently sloping catchment can be better represented by TINs
	(fewer nodes and improved aqccuracy for a given tolerance level)
	
	- TINs simulate larger domains better than raster-based models
	
	- TINs generated with focus on hydrological similarity better at capturing
	hydrological variability than hydrographic TINs
	
	- TINs permit smooth transition between continental basin and multiple
	nested watersheds; hydrologic signature at each scale can be preserved
	
	
	Limitations:
	
	- aggregation errors propagating to predictions of a hydrological
	model may occur based on the selected method and the chosen acceptable
	error level
	
	- resolution errors might occur (e.g. if floodplain area is not represented
	acurately as dynamics of variable saource area is then not well captured)
	
	- relative complexity of data structures and algorithms in comparison
	to raster grid-based approaches
	
	
	Motivation:
	
	- traditional representation of terrain data in hydrological models:
	
	 1. aggregation or resampling DEMs to coearser resolution
	
	 2. topographic distribution functions
	
	- no approach can incorporate all igh-resolution topographic data
	available
	
	- need for efficient method representing high-resolution terrain with
	minimal loss of information
	
	
	Triangulated Irregular Networks (TIN):
	
	- computational structures to represent topography: regular grids,
	contour lines, TINs
	
	- TIN data structure: piece-wise linear interpolation of a set of
	points of a DEM resulting in nonoverlapping triangular elements varying
	in size
	
	- Delaunay triangulation as preferred method
	
	- motivation for representation of watershed topography:
	
	 1. variable resolution by irregular domain
	
	 - computational savings as number of nodes can be reduced in regions
	of low terrain variability
	
	 - allows TIN-based models to operate over large regions
	
	 2. linear features can be preserved in the model mesh
	
	 - e.g. terrain breaklines, stream networks, boundaries between heterogeneous
	regions
	
	 - no artifacts as in raster discretization
	
	- only few studies addressed TIN methods
	
	
	Topographic (traditional) TIN:
	
	- selective sampling of high-resolution DEM according to a topographic
	criterion
	
	- preserves key topographic characteristics
	
	- GIS sampling rechniques:
	
	 - very important point (VIP) method, local procedure, determining
	the significance of a point relative to a filter
	
	 - drop heuristic (DH) method, global procedure, successively reduces
	DEM points and retains only significant points
	
	
	Hydrographic TIN:
	
	- combines traditional approach with representation of surface streams,
	basin boundaries, and floodplains
	
	1. stream network calculation from a DEM
	
	 - various algorithms exist
	
	 - herein a constant area method is used to classify DEM points as
	stream cells
	
	 - simplification and generalization to remove raster effects
	
	2. boundary delineation from a DEM
	
	 - create depressionless DEM
	
	 - derive overland flow directions
	
	 - compute upslope area at each outlet
	
	 - simplification and generalization to remove raster effects
	
	3. flood plains and riparian zones
	
	 - integrate existing floodplain model from field work OR
	
	 - algorithm for delineation from DEM
	
	 - here, elevation-threshold algorithm is used
	
	4. landscape features
	
	 - available landscape feature maps (soil, land use, geology, etc.)
	can be directly included OR
	
	 - combined features such as HRUs can be included
	
	
	Hydrological similarity TIN:
	
	- new method to cature hydrologic dynamics in TINs using a measure
	of hydrological similarity
	
	- here, topographic index (TOPMODEL) is used to derive topographic
	distribution classes
	
	 - determine steady-state hydrologic response in a basin
	
	 - measure of hydrological similarity for catchments dominated by
	saturation excess runoff
	
	 - divides areas saturating frequently from upslope regions that lack
	runoff production
	
	 - in frequently saturated areas (high index value) more points in
	the TIN are retained
	
	- establish a functional relationship between index class and distance
	between selected DEM points
	
	- hydrological similarity TIN then samples a raster DEM with a variable
	resolution filter
	
	- after point selection triangulation is used to create a TIN},

	Motivation:
	
	- drainage basin as fundamental unit for surface water systems
	
	- aquifer systems fundamental unit for groundwater
	
	- framework needed that considers the complete hydrological system
	
	
	Hydrologic landscape:

	landscapes
	
	- physiographic feature = fundamental hydrologic landscape unit (FHLU):
	
	 1. landsurface form (upland -> slope -> lowland)

	change with increases in catchment scale?
	
	
	Motivation
	
	- consistent theory for analyzing catchment responses at different
	scales
	
	- linking phenomena at field scales and catchment scales is an unresolved
	problem
	
	- runoff generation is a multiscale phenomenon with different length
	scales
	
	
	Conclusions
	
	- REA exists in the context of runoff generation response of catchments
	
	- REA strongly influenced by topography
	
	- soil and rainfall input variability of minor importance in determining
	the size of a REA
	
	
	Representative Elementary Area
	
	- spatially integrated representative catchment or assemblage of such
	representative subcatchments
	
	- averaging area acting as the smallest discernible point which is
	representative of the continuum is defined as REA
	
	- use of simple phenomenological equations to quantify runoff generation
	instead of differential equation formulations
	
	- required properties for a valid REA:
	
	 1. length scale of rapidly varying components << length scale of
	slowly varying components << length scale of the REA
	
	 2. average values obtained must be independent of the size of the
	REA
	
	 3. triplet of length scales (1.) must be constant for each field
	property and invariant in space and time
	
	 4. REA scale representation must contain all the physics of the sub-REA
	processes
	
	
	Model study
	
	- simulation approach to investigate existence of a REA
	
	- catchment: Coweeta River experimental catchment, North Carolina,
	USA
	
	- model: spatially distributed version of TOPMODEL
	
	
	Results
	
	- common threshold size for all studied outputs of 1km2
	
	- shape of natural subcatchments may affect the REA size
	
	- variability between subcatchment responses due to rainfall and soil
	variability

	Thermodynamic perspective: \par
	
	- second law of thermodynamics: \par
	
	 - (potential) gradients are depleted by fluxes that are caused by
	these gradients \par
	
	 - implies production of entropy and dissipation of free energy (i.e.
	the capacity of a system to perform work) \par
	
	 - flux = conductance (inverse of resistance) * gradient \par
	
	 - magnitude of fluxes controlled by: governing equations, relevant
	resistances, thermodynamic limits \par
	
	- isolated systems: \par
	
	 - exchange neither mass nor energy \par
	
	 - evolve to a dead state of maximum entropy, i.e. a thermodynamic
	equilibrium \par
	
	- open systems: \par
	
	 - export entropy to the environment \par
	
	 - maintain a spatial configuration far from equilibrium \par
	
	- two forms of water release from a catchment: \par
	
	 - water vapor to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration \par
	
	 - driven by radiative heating \par
	
	 - plants as preferential flow paths for water from the soil \par
	
	 - entropy production largely dominated by ET \par
	
	 - entropy export by outgoing long-wave radiation and turbulent heat
	fluxes \par
	
	 - streamflow \par
	
	 - driven by gravity \par
	
	 - max fluxes linked to conversion of free energy (chemical energy,
	pot. and kin. energy of soil or surface water) \par
	
	 - energy conversion related to partition of rainfall to runoff components
	and storage dynamics \par
	
	 - entropy production by energy conversion \par
	
	
	Landscape organization \par
	
	- spatial organization affects gradients and resistances \par
	
	- persistence of topographic gradients most obvious form of organization
	\par
	
	- omnipresence of networks of preferential flow paths as example of
	spatial organization \par
	
	- idea of HRU implies that landscape evolution creates spatial organization,
	reflected in similar hydrologial behaviour \par
	
	- might be a result of co-evolution of distinct natural communities,
	landscape characteristics, and suitable management practices \par
	
	- structural similarity might imply that past process patterns and
	human disturbances have been similar \par
	
	
	Propose of three specific functional units: \par
	
	1. Elementary functional units (EFU): \par
	
	- similar terrestrial controls on surface energy balance \par
	
	- control functional similarity during radiation-driven conditions
	\par
	
	- represented by the same parameter set related to energy balance
	and vertical flows \par
	
	- first guess predictors: land use, management practice, location
	within catena, hillslope aspect \par
	
	2. Lateral topological units (LTU): \par
	
	- similar terrestrial controls on rainfall runoff generation \par
	
	- control functional similarity \par
	
	- represented by same parameter set characterizing lateral flows and
	EFU-scale parameters \par
	
	- first guess predictors: surface and bedrock topography and morphology,
	land use \par 
	
	3. Subcatchment scale hydro-geomorphic units (HGU) \par
	
	- headwater or subcatchment scale \par
	
	- homogeneity with respect to groundwater storage and release \par
	
	- determined by geology, land use, climatic setting \par
	
	
	Structural adequate modelling \par
	
	- should be thermodynamically consistent (see above) \par
	
	 - allows constraining behavioral flow resistances by available information
	\par
	
	 - to determine parameters in a practical feasible manner structural
	and functional parameter sets must be transferable among members
	of the same EFU or LTU \par
	
	- separate treatment of fluxes in matrix/continuum elements and connected
	network-like structures \par
	
	 - because different forms of fluxes (matrix flow vs. preferential
	flow) dominated by different forces and deplete different gradients
	and are independent sources of equifinality \par
	
	- balances necessary complexity with the greatest possible parsimony
	\par
	
	 - key factors: spatial organisation, preferential flow paths and
	how to couple fast and slow flow domains, conceptualization of driving
	gradients \par
	
	- existing approaches: \par
	
	 - representative elementary watershed (REW) \par
	
	 - hillslope storage Boussinesq (HSB) \par
	
	 - conceptualizations of landscape characteristics (e.g. TOPMODEL,
	WASA, mHm) \par

	- EFU: 
	
	 - vertical flows of land-surface energy exchange and ET (Penman-Monteith)
	
	 - vertical flows during radiation-driven conditions (capillary rise,
	soil heat): Darcy-Richards equation
	
	 - vertical flows during gravity-driven conditions (preferential macropore
	flow): kinematic wave or stochastic approach \par
	
	 - water beyond saturation: directed to macropore domain or Rapid
	Subsurface Flow object connecting EFUs along downslope gradient \par
	
	 - lower boundary conditions: free drainage to slow groundwater flow
	\par
	
	- lateral exchange by overland flow or subsurface lateral flow by
	diffusion wave or Darcy-Weisbach equation \par
	
	- base flow through diffusion wave equation \par
